        <h2>Here are some ways to protect them:</h2>
        <h2>Preserve Natural Habitats:</h2>
        <p>Support and contribute to the conservation of forests, wetlands, prairies, and other critical bird habitats.
            Advocate for laws and policies that protect natural areas and biodiversity.</p>
        <h2>Create Bird-Friendly Environments:</h2>
        <p>Plant native trees, shrubs, and flowers in your garden to provide birds with food, shelter, and nesting sites.
            Install bird feeders and water baths. Ensure they are clean and placed safely to reduce the risk of window collisions or predation.</p>
        <h2>Reduce Window Collisions:</h2>
        <p>Apply decals, screens, or bird-safe glass to windows to make them more visible to birds.
            Position bird feeders either closer than 3 feet or further than 30 feet from windows to minimize collision risks.</p>
        <h2>Limit Use of Pesticides and Chemicals:</h2>
        <p>Use organic gardening practices to minimize the use of harmful pesticides and chemicals that can poison birds directly or deplete their food sources.</p>
        <h2>Reduce Plastic Use and Properly Dispose of Waste:</h2>
        <p>Plastics and litter can harm birds and their habitats. Reduce plastic use and ensure waste is properly disposed of to prevent birds from getting tangled or ingesting toxic materials.</p>
